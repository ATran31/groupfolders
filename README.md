# Group folders

Admin configured folders shared by everyone in a group.

## Configure folders

Folders can be configured from *Group folders* in the admin settings.

After a folder is created, the admin can give access to the folder to one or more groups.

## Folders

Once configured, the folders will show up in the home folder for each user in the configured groups.

## A note about encryption and data storage

Currently using encryption on group folders is not supported and files are always stored locally inside the data directory even when a different primary storage such as objectstore has been configured.
